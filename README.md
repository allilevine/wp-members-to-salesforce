wp-members-to-salesforce
========================

If youâ€™re using the WP-Members plugin to register new members but would also like to capture that information in Salesforce, you can use this plugin file to do so.  I adapted it for WP-Members from the <a href="http://formidablepro.com/help-desk/salesforce-plugin/">Salesforce add-on plugin</a> FormidablePro provides.  Fill in your Salesforce OID, place the plugin in its own folder under wp-content/plugins, and activate the plugin from the Dashboard.
